SantaSecretList
Ho Ho Ho!

Santa's workers have already begun working for Christmas this year. Santa has been watching over the kids from all over the world and made a note of the behaviour of all the kids. He sent that data over to his factory where all the cool toys are made.

Now, the elves need to figure out how many toys are to be made along with the names of the kids to send charcoal to.

So, you will have to create two lists on the basis of data sent over by Santa. 
List 1 - "Nice List", add the names of all the kids that are nice. 
List 2 - "Naughty List", add the names of all the kids that are naughty.

Help Santa and the elves out in this mission and you may be rewarded!

For simplicity's sake, duplicate names are allowed on the lists.

Input Format

This is the data Santa sent over to his factory
4 
1 Sam 
2 Dean 
1 Castiel 
2 Crowley 
The first value is the number of kids in the list, n (int). 
The next n values will be two space separated values, the first will be the behaviour of the kid and the second will be the name of the kid 
value 1 for behaviour represents nice 
value 2 for behaviour represents naughty

Constraints

n <= 1000 the value for behaviour can only be either 1 or 2 
the number of gifts <= n

Output Format

Sam, Nice 
Dean, Naughty 
Castiel, Nice 
Crowley, Naughty 
The Naughty List 
Dean 
Crowley 
2 
The first n values in the output are the names of the n kids sent by Santa, along with their classification as either naughty or nice. 
Next is a simple print statement with the String "The Naughty List" 
The next values are the names of the kids that are naughty. 
The last integer value is the total number of gifts that the elves have to make this year.
